### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile! Here you'll find projects and experiments related to my fascination with code. I never know if something will work out, but when I create, I try to have fun and deepen my knowledge of computer science. Who knows, maybe one day I'll even program a robot for you! ðŸ˜„

Feel free to browse through my repositories and discover new ideas! ðŸ˜ŠðŸš€ PS: We all have to start somewhere ðŸ˜‰
